Objective
Interface a DHT sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity. Display the readings on an LCD screen or serial monitor.

Key Activities
- Lcd Interfacing with DHT sensor
- Monitoring data from DHT22

Technologies Used
- Hardware Setup: Requires arduino uno board, DHT22 sensor, resistor(optional), potentiometer, breadboard, jumper wires. 
- Simulator: If no hardware, then same can be implemented using wokwi simulator ye using above components.
- Embedded C
